## Audio Implementation Guidelines

### Volume Balancing
- Movement sounds: -8dB (subtle)
- Drop sounds: -6dB to -4dB (moderate)
- Line clears: -5dB to -3dB (prominent)
- Special moves: -5dB (distinctive)
- UI sounds: -8dB to -7dB (unobtrusive)
- Progression: -4dB (impactful)

### Playback Recommendations
1. **Simultaneous Sounds**: Design allows multiple sounds to play together without masking
2. **Priority System**: Tetris/Level Up > Line Clear > Special Moves > Drops > Movement
3. **Ducking**: Consider reducing music volume during major sound events

### Performance Optimization
- Total size of all SFX: ~80KB
- Minimal memory footprint
- No compression artifacts at game-relevant frequencies
- Instant playback with no loading delays

## Synthesis Techniques Used

### Advanced Audio Processing
1. **ADSR Envelopes**: Custom attack, decay, sustain, release for each sound
2. **Frequency Modulation**: Creates complex timbres (T-spin effect)
3. **Additive Synthesis**: Multiple sine waves for rich harmonics
4. **Subtractive Synthesis**: Filtered noise for texture
5. **Time-Varying Filters**: Dynamic frequency sweeps
6. **Reverb Processing**: Spatial enhancement for key sounds
7. **Amplitude Modulation**: Shimmer and tremolo effects

### Signal Processing
- Butterworth filters for smooth frequency response
- Exponential decay for natural sound tails
- Crossfading for smooth transitions
- White noise generation for texture
- Pitch bending for dynamic effects

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Adaptive Audio**: Sounds that change based on game speed/level
2. **Spatial Audio**: 3D positioning for multiplayer modes
3. **Dynamic Music Integration**: Sounds that sync with background music
4. **Accessibility Options**: Alternative sound sets for different needs
5. **Theme Variations**: Different sound packs for various game themes

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **OGG Vorbis**: Consider for better compression
2. **Audio Sprites**: Combine sounds into single file
3. **Procedural Generation**: Real-time synthesis on device
4. **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilize Android audio effects API
